## welcome to pivotal tracker
- created the various chores to the project
1. Part One: Set up a local development environment and then deploy both a staging and a production environment on Heroku. (current)
### tasks
1. project setup
- initialised git
- cloned py-ex repo
- moved to py-ex
- `git checkout setting_up`
- `git add *`

- set up virtual enviroment
`virtual env`
- activate virtual enviroment(windows)
`source env/Scripts/activatels`

- install flask
- test flask by hello world


2. Heroku setup
- install guicorn==19.4.5
- pip freeze > requirements.txt

# heroku bug.

- could not push app to heroku
**soloution**
- created the various apps
- cloned them on different location

3. staging/production workflow
- made changes to stage only
This staging/production workflow allows us to make changes, show things to clients, experiment, etc. - all within a sandboxed server without causing any changes to the live production site that users are, well, using.


4. config setting
- `touch config.py`



2. Part Two: Set up a PostgreSQL database along with SQLAlchemy and Alembic to handle migrations.
3. Part Three: Add in the back-end logic to scrape and then process the word counts from a webpage using the requests, BeautifulSoup, and Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) libraries.
4. Part Four: Implement a Redis task queue to handle the text processing.
5. Part Five: Set up Angular on the front-end to continuously poll the back-end to see if the request is done processing.
6. Part Six: Push to the staging server on Heroku - setting up Redis and detailing how to run two processes (web and worker) on a single Dyno.
7. Part Seven: Update the front-end to make it more user-friendly.
8. Part Eight: Create a custom Angular Directive to display a frequency distribution chart using JavaScript and D3.
